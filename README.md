# ProcessManager

## Introduction

> The ProcessManager allows you to manage (define,execute...) arbitrary processes/commands in the Pimcore backend. 
You can display the execution progress of the script in the Admin interface and the user can view the detailed log information. 
In addition you can define "actions" - e.g.  a download of a file after the process has finished. Furthermore callback actions are available and the processes are monitored (you get an email if a process dies)

[For detailed information take a look at the Wiki](https://gitlab.elements.at/pimcore-plugins/ProcessManager/wikis/home)
