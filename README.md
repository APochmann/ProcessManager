# ProcessManager

## Installation
{
    "require": {
        "pimcore-plugins/ProcessManager": "~1.0"
    },
    "repositories": [
        { "type": "composer", "url": "https://composer-packages.elements.at/" }
    ]
}
```

**Be careful, normally there's already a `require` node, so you need to add the new line at the bottom**     

Run composer update: 
`composer update`
