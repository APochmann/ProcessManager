### Configuration
The [default configuration file](../src/Elements/Bundle/ProcessManagerBundle/Resources/install/plugin-process-manager.php) gets copied to `<Pimcore root folder>/var/config/plugin-process-manager.php`. You can change those settings either directly in the file or by overriding it in a new file called `<Pimcore root folder>/app/config/pimcore/plugin-process-manager.php`.
